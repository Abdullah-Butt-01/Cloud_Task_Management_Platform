# Log Processing System Migration

## Goal

Convert the current TXT file processing system into a log processing and observability-style system.

The final system should accept log files, process them in the background, and generate useful operational insights such as counts, severity summaries, error patterns, and other observability signals.

## Working Strategy

Each step should follow this rule:

1. Do one thing.
2. Keep the system working.
3. Make the change commit-worthy.
4. Teach one concept.

## How Each Step Will Be Documented

For every incremental step, this file will be updated with:

- Step name
- What the step is going to do
- What was already present in the system
- What needed to change
- Files changed
- How to test the step
- Concept learned

## Current System Baseline

The current project is a Dockerized background file processing system.

### Existing Capabilities

- Flask API accepts uploaded `.txt` files.
- Uploaded files are saved to a shared `uploads` directory.
- A `FileJob` database record is created for each upload.
- Redis Queue stores background jobs.
- A worker container processes queued jobs asynchronously.
- PostgreSQL stores job metadata, status, counts, retry count, and errors.
- Dashboard displays processed file results.
- Worker heartbeat can be checked through a debug route.
- Scheduler can mark stuck processing jobs as failed.

### Current Processing Output

The current worker extracts basic text-file statistics:

- Word count
- Line count
- Character count

### Target Direction

The system will move from generic text statistics toward log observability insights, such as:

- Total log lines
- Log level counts
- Error count
- Warning count
- Most common error messages
- Time range covered by the log file
- Failed or malformed line count
- Basic health/status summary

## Step Log

### Step 1 - Project Cleanup

#### Goal

Clean the project folders and structure before converting the system from generic file processing into log processing.

#### What Was Already Present

- Routes were already inside `app/routes`.
- Models were already inside `app/models`.
- Background processing already existed through Redis Queue and a worker.
- The active file-processing database model already existed as `FileJob`.

#### What Needed To Change

- Some files still had old names from previous versions of the project:
  - `app/routes/tasks.py` was no longer about tasks.
  - `app/routes/upload_routes.py` handled all file job APIs but had an upload-only name.
  - `app/jobs.py` mixed processing logic and reporting logic in one file.
  - `app/models/task.py` and `app/models/user.py` were legacy models not used by the current file-processing system.

#### Changes Made

- Replaced `app/routes/tasks.py` with `app/routes/system_routes.py`.
- Replaced `app/routes/upload_routes.py` with `app/routes/file_routes.py`.
- Converted `app/jobs.py` into an `app/jobs` package.
- Added `app/jobs/file_processing.py` for background file processing and retry handling.
- Added `app/jobs/reports.py` for report generation jobs.
- Added `app/jobs/__init__.py` to keep imports simple.
- Removed legacy `Task` and `User` model imports from `app/main.py`.
- Deleted legacy model files:
  - `app/models/task.py`
  - `app/models/user.py`

#### Files Changed

- `app/main.py`
- `app/routes/system_routes.py`
- `app/routes/file_routes.py`
- `app/jobs/__init__.py`
- `app/jobs/file_processing.py`
- `app/jobs/reports.py`
- `app/models/task.py`
- `app/models/user.py`
- `docs/LogProcessingMigration.md`

#### How To Test

Run a syntax check:

```bash
python -m compileall app
```

Run the system:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Check the main routes:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/
curl http://localhost:5000/files
curl http://localhost:5000/debug/workers
```

Upload a text file:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/upload -F "file=@sample.txt"
```

#### Concept Learned

Project structure should follow responsibility, not history.

This step did not add new log-processing behavior. It made the code easier to extend by giving each part a clear place:

- Route files handle HTTP endpoints.
- Model files define database tables.
- Job files hold background work.
- Utility files hold shared helper logic.

This keeps future changes smaller, safer, and easier to explain.
